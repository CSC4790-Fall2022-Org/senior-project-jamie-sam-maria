# Student Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Jamie Cha, Maria Molina, & Samuel Dennis

Summary of project: 
Creating a multifactor authentication for when an RFID is in use. If the RFID is scanned, the user should get a notification to authorize access. For example, if a user were to scan their card that has an RFID, they would get a push notification as a second authentication to ensure that they are the ones that are trying to scan their card. We are also writing a research paper on multifactor authentication.
